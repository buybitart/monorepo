# BitcoinArt

**An open-source solution giving Bitcoin artists, makers, and independent creators their own customizable, self-hosted website complete with e-commerce and auction tools to showcase and sell handmade, Bitcoin-inspired artworks directly to collectors. Because an independently hosted site is the only place you fully control your content and presentation and the only place immune to deletion or censorship, it becomes your forever home on the web.**

## About

Hi, I'm Aksana (aka 5Ksana), a Bitcoin artist and fashion designer from Poland. Since 2017, I've been creating physical Bitcoin-inspired art, and I have over 22 years of experience as a professional tailor. Learn more about me here: [https://buybitart.com/about](https://buybitart.com/about)

We recently launched [buybitart.com](https://buybitart.com), a simple, open-source site for Bitcoin artists, as well as for independent creators:

- Showcase original, handmade artwork
- Sell via an online store or auctions
- Accept BTC payments via BTCPay Server
- Support USDT and credit card payments through Stripe

My husband Aliaksandr [GitHub](https://github.com/Berichicko), a few close friends, and I built this from scratch using our personal savings. Our goal is to empower artists, especially in restrictive countries, to share and sell their work globally without banks or middlemen, promoting creative freedom and financial independence with open-source Bitcoin tools.

## Configuration

Sample environment variables:

```dotenv
# backend/.env
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@db:5432/bitcoinart
BTCPAY_URL=https://your-btcpay-server
BTCPAY_API_KEY=your_btcpay_api_key

# frontend/.env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=localhost:4000/api
```

Ensure real credentials are secured and never committed to Git. `.gitignore` excludes all `.env` files by default.

## Architecture

1. **User Browser** → requests UI from **Frontend** (React, Vite)  
2. **Frontend** → interacts with **Backend** (Node.js, Express)  
3. **Backend** → reads/writes to **PostgreSQL**, and routes payments to **BTCPay Server** (BTC) & **Stripe** (USDT & cards)

## Principles & Values

We align with UNESCO’s definition of **artistic freedom** the right “to imagine, create and distribute diverse cultural expressions free of governmental censorship, political interference or pressures of non-state actors,” and “the ability of individuals to access diverse cultural expressions” 

---

## Roadmap

- **Localization & Internationalization**  
  Add support for multiple languages, locale-aware formatting, and right-to-left layouts where needed.  
- **Accessibility Enhancements**  
  Improve compliance with WCAG guidelines: keyboard navigation, screen-reader labels, color contrast, and assistive technologies support.  
- **User Experience (UX) Improvements**  
  Refine user flows, optimize performance, enhance mobile and low-bandwidth experiences, and gather user feedback for iterative design.
